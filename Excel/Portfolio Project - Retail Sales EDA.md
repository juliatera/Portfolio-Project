This is a Portfolio Project about Retail Sales in fictional Store. I gathered the data from Kaggle [Download](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mohammadtalib786/retail-sales-dataset)

Date, Customer ID, Gender, Age, Product Category, Quantity, Price per Unit, and Total Amount. These attributes enable a multifaceted exploration of sales trends, demographic influences, and purchasing behaviors.
